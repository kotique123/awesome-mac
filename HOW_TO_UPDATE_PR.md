   - ✅ Actively maintained
   - ✅ Well-documented with clear README

### Further Comments

FnKeyboard fills a niche in the productivity tools space by providing a simple, non-intrusive solution for accessing function keys on macOS. It's particularly useful for users who frequently use function keys for app shortcuts and prefer a lightweight, menu-bar based solution. The application doesn't duplicate functionality from existing entries in the awesome-mac list.
